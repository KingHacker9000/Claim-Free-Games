# Claim-Free-Games
Automatically Claims Free Games from the epic Games Launcher Store using Chrome/Chromium


# How To Use
Either Download The Executble File
                or
Download The Python File And Run (Make sure to download All imports using Pip)
This is a Python 3 script, if it wont start on Ubuntu/Debian try to run it with python3 ex
python3 Buy_Free_Games.py

If you use a Linux based OS please install the ChromeDriver package
On Ubuntu/Mint/Popos install it with  sudo apt install chromium-chromedriver
On other Distros, use your package manager of choice (The package is available on AUR from Arch/Manjaro)

This should be able to run on MacOS but i have not tried it. 
Just install chromedriver from any third party package manager like homebrew.
